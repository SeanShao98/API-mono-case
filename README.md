# API-mono-case
(WIP) Downstream FPP price effect of upstream API monopolization

## intro

This project focuses on **estimating the impact of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) monopolization on downstream final pharmaceutical product (FPP) market prices** within the pharmaceutical industry supply chain. It serves as a solid application of the multiple synthetic-DiD implemented in `R`. The R-based workflow, including the generation of relevant charts and statistics, is particularly insightful.

I first presented our findings through conference **slides**, which you may find interestingðŸ˜‰. The related working paper will soon be available on SSRN. I will continuously push updates.
